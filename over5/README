------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the source code for the Amiga programs of
the Over5 package.

Over5 on the WWW: (contains the latest release)
  http://www.stacken.kth.se/~tlr/computing/over5.html

If you modify this, and want the modifications to be released then
send me the new code (source additions), and I will release it as
soon as possible. (with proper credit to you of course.)

I would very much like bug fixes but please don't release any
versions of these programs yourself.  Send your updates to me
and I will administrate the releases.

You need:
  SAS/C 6.51 by SAS Institute Inc or compatible
  'Flexrev' 0.55 or later by Daniel Kahlin
