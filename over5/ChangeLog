	* main.c: Fixed silly bug that made over5 think that the serial
	port couldn't be opened when it really could.
	* bl_serial.c: Kludged around the SIMPLEREAD bug on win32.  It
	seems that SerRead doesn't work with a serial buffer size less
	than the chunk to be read(!)
	* over5.cfg: Default to COM1, use CR/LF.

2002-05-04  Daniel Kahlin <daniel@kahlin.net>
	* mach_include.h: Removed.
	* config.h.in: Stuff from mach_include.h moved here.
	* Removed _alot_ of unnecessary #includes from everywhere!

2002-05-03  Daniel Kahlin <daniel@kahlin.net>
	* Converted to tabsize=4 (most of it was already)
	* util.c util.h: created file for collecting the various utilty
	functions that was lying around in main for example.

2002-05-02  Daniel Kahlin <daniel@kahlin.net>
	* Stripped out AMIGA_VERSION code. (most of it wasn't there anyway)
	* Stripped out APTR and STRPTR.
	* Improved building. Cross MinGW32 build works, warnings removed.
	* Cosmetics.
	* main.c: Added aliases for the sub commands. 
	* pr_server.c: Tempfile now has an absolute path in a temporary
	directory.

	* Fixed really, _really_ stupid bug in SerRead.
	(I had commented out the code that sets two stopbits.)
	Kludged around the 'no copy to .' bug. Not very pretty.
	The Linux version is much faster now:
	readdisk ~2.40 min, writedisk ~4.45 min.

	* Autoconf for the host program seems to work.
	Fixed some problems with a nonblocking tcdrain();
	Some (very) minor documentation updates.

	should be included now, lets start the work.
