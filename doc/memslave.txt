memslave
--------
  memslave is a memory server for the C64/VIC20.  It supports the following
over5 protocols: READMEM, WRITEMEM, SYS & RUN.   RESET is supported if
additional hardware is added (see interface.txt for details). 

USAGE:
  Load and run.
Initially memslave will locate itself at $c500-$cfff.

At the menu:
- Pressing <space> will enter the server mode, and start waiting for commands.
- Pressing 'p' will install a reset patch.  When the patch is installed,
  memslave will enter server mode directly after a reset.
  Holding down <space> during reset will do a normal reset.
  Holding down '<-' during reset will bring up the menu.
- Pressing 'r' will allow you to relocate memslave to any page in memory.
  Note: No part of memslave may be in the areas $0000-$07ff, $a000-$bfff or
  $d000-$ffff!

To restart after reset or similar, type 'SYS 2069'.
(SYS 51200 for MemSlaveC800)


System requirements:

  Over5 64binaries should run on any c64 or c128(in c64 mode), although it
has only been tested on an old c64 with, and without TFC III.  If you find
bugs or have suggestions about how to make any of the programs better please
send a bugreport and/or a list of suggestions to the address at the end of
this text.
