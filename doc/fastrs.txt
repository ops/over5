fastrs
------
  fastrs is a memory transferrer for the C64/VIC20, much like a tapeturbo,
It supports the following over5 protocols: SIMPLEREAD and SIMPLEWRITE. 

  fastrs for the C64 will install itself to $02bb-$02f9 and $fc00-$ffff. 

  fastrs for the VIC20 will install itself to $02bb-$02ca and 
MEMTOP-$0400 - MEMTOP (which is $5c00-$5fff on a 16KB expanded VIC20)

USAGE:
  Load and run.
Now it is installed in memory.

To receive:
  type 'SYS 700'.  You will see the text 'WAITING...' and then
the screen blanks.  Now type 'over5 SIMPLEWRITE <filename>' on the PC to
send.

To send:
  Start 'over5 SIMPLEREAD <filename>' on the PC. It should tell you
'Waiting...'.  Now type 'SYS 703' on the C64/VIC20 to send.


System requirements:

  fastrs should run on any C64 or VIC20, although it has only been tested
on an old C64 with, and without TFC III, and AR IV.  And a VIC20 with and
without 16Kb memory expansion.
If you find bugs or have suggestions about how to make any of the programs
better please send a bugreport and/or a list of suggestions to
<over5@kahlin.net>.
