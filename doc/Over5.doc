Over5 on the WWW: (contains the latest release)
  http://www.stacken.kth.se/~tlr/computing/over5.html

GENERAL:

  Over5 (the successor to OverFour) is an AMIGA to/from C64 transfer program
package.  It was made because of too many burnt 6526's and 8520's.  To
overcome that problem I chose to use a standard RS-232 interface.

Over5 contains several commands:  COPY, WRITEFILE, READFILE, WRITEMEM,
  READMEM, SYS, RUN, RESET, SIMPLEWRITE, SIMPLEREAD, BOOT, DIR, STATUS,
  COMMAND, WRITEDISK, READDISK, WRITEZIP, READZIP, TEST, SERVER, HELP.

CONFIG FILE:
------------
  At startup Over5 tries to load the file 'PROGDIR:Over5.config'.
Here is an example config containing the default values:

--------------------

;
; over5.config
; comment
# comment
;
DEVICE=8	;cbm device number
SERIALDEVICE=serial.device
SERIALUNIT=0
#
# end of file
#
--------------------


NUMBER INPUT:
-------------
  Most parameters which expects a number can be fed with different
radixes.  The default radix for addresses is 16 (hex).  For device
numbers the default is 10 (dec).

prefixes:
  '%'       binary  (ex: %11001)
  '$','0x'  hexadecimal  (ex: $ef, 0xfce2)
  '@'       octal (ex: @377)
  '+', '#'  decimal (ex: +255, #16)

(the prefix is ofcourse only necessary if the wanted radix differs from
 the default radix.)



THE COMMANDS:
-------------


command COPY:
-------------

TEMPLATE: Over5 COPY FROM/M,TO/A,DEBUG/S

  FROM/M    source file/files 
  TO/A      destination file/path
  DEBUG/S   sets debug mode (shows all packets).

copies source to destination (like AmigaDOS copy) but '<devnum>:'
is the cbm drive. (ex. '8:','9:')
Wildcards are fully supported.  Cbm filenames may end with ',<s|p|u|r>'
which indicates SEQ/PRG/USR/REL files. (the default is ',p')  When
wildcards are used with cbm files, only the filetype specified matches.

examples:

> Over5 COPY 8:a#?.src,s ram:
will copy cbm files like 'APA.SRC' and 'AFFE.SRC' (SEQ) to 'ram:apa.src'
and 'ram:affe.src'.

> Over5 COPY work:c64/dl_demos/#?.tlr 8:
will copy 'work:c64/dl_demos/neat-oh.tlr' to the cbm file 'NEAT-OH.TLR'
(PRG).

> Over5 COPY mysource.asm 8:,s
will copy 'mysource.asm' to the cbm file 'MYSOURCE.ASM' (SEQ).

> Over5 COPY #?(.asm|.i) 8:,u
will copy files like 'one.asm' and 'two.i' to the cbm files 'ONE.ASM'
(USR) and 'TWO.I' (USR).

System requirements:

  Over5 should run on any system setup running OS2.04 or higher, although it
has only been tested on an A3000/25 running OS3.1.  If you find bugs or have
suggestions about how to make the program better please send a bugreport or
a list of suggestions to the address at the end of this text.
