diskslave
---------
  diskslave is a disk server for the C64/VIC20 and 1541.  It supports
the following over5 protocols: READFILE, WRITEFILE, COPY, DIR, STATUS,
COMMAND, READDISK, WRITEDISK, READZIP, WRITEZIP and TEST.
It includes diskturbo for: read/writefile, read/writedisk read/writezip
and fastformat.
The diskturbo code can be switched off at the menu.
You can turn off verify if you really want to.  I do NOT recommend this!
Pressing <RESTORE> returns to menu.

USAGE:
  Load and run.
To restart after reset or similar, type 'SYS 2069'.

System requirements:

  Over5 64binaries should run on any c64 or c128(in c64 mode), although it
has only been tested on an old c64 with, and without TFC III.  If you find
bugs or have suggestions about how to make any of the programs better please
send a bugreport and/or a list of suggestions to the address at the end of
this text.
