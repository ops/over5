Documentation:

  Over5 64binaries are: DiskSlave, MemSlave, MemSlaveC800, SerFile & FastRS.



DiskSlave:
----------
  DiskSlave is a disk server for the c64/1541.  It supports the following:
READ/WRITEFILE (COPY), DIR, STATUS, COMMAND, READ/WRITEDISK and TEST.
Includes diskturbo for: read/writefile, read/writedisk and fastformat.
The diskturbo code can be switched off at the menu.
You can turn off verify if you really want to.  I do NOT recommend this!
Pressing <RESTORE> returns to menu.

USAGE:
  Load and run.
To restart after reset or similar, type 'SYS 2069'.



MemSlave & MemSlaveC800:
------------------------
  MemSlave is a memory server for the c64.  It supports the following:
READ/WRITEMEM, SYS, RUN. 

USAGE:
  Load and run.
To restart after reset or similar, type 'SYS 2069'.
(SYS 51200 for MemSlaveC800)



SerFile:
--------
  SerFile uses the Amiga as harddisk server.  (run 'Over5 Server')

USAGE:
  Load and run.
Now it is installed ($f600-$ffff)

Commands:

  'LOAD "<FILENAME>",6'
  '#L"<FILENAME>"'
  '/ "<FILENAME>"' or '/<FILENAME>'
Loads the file from the server into memory.

  'SAVE "<FILENAME>",6'
  '#S"<FILENAME>"'
Saves file from memory to the server.

  '#C"<COMMAND>"'
  '."<COMMAND"' or '.<COMMAND>'
Sends command to the server. ('#$' can be used instead of '#C"$"')

  '#C"DIR"'
  '#C"$"'
  '#$'
  '$'
  '.$'
Displays the files in the current directory.

  '#C"CD"'
  '.CD'
Displays the name of the current directory.

  '#C"CD <dir>"'
  '.CD <dir>'
Set the current directory to <dir>.

Please refer to Over5.doc for additional '#C' commands.

  '#K'
Uninstalls SerFile.

The '#L', '/' and '#S' commands are slightly better than 'LOAD' / 'SAVE' because
they do not use BASIC variable storage to store the filename.  (i.e they do
not trash memory just below $a000)

SerFile looks dead during transfer. (screen blanked, no flashing)
This is normal!  I will make it flash a bit in late versions.



FastRS:
-------
  FastRS is a memory transferrer for the c64, much like a tapeturbo,  It
supports the following: SIMPLEREAD and SIMPLEWRITE. 

  FastRS for the Vic-20 is a prototype version, works only with 16KB.
works the same as the c64 version except it installs at $5c00-$6000.

USAGE:
  Load and run.
Now it is installed. ($fc00-$ffff)

To receive:
  type 'SYS 700'.  You will see the text 'WAITING...' and then
the screen blanks.  Now type 'Over5 SIMPLEWRITE <filename>' on the Amiga to
send.

To send:
  Start 'Over5 SIMPLEREAD <filename>' on the Amiga. It should tell you
'Waiting...'.  Now type 'SYS 703' on the c64 to send.



System requirements:

  Over5 64binaries should run on any c64 or c128(in c64 mode), although it
has only been tested on an old c64 with, and without TFC III.  If you find
bugs or have suggestions about how to make any of the programs better please
send a bugreport and/or a list of suggestions to the address at the end of
this text.
