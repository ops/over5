Documentation:

TEMPLATE: bList FROM/A,LG=LASERGENIUS/S,TA=TURBOASSEMBLER/S

where "FROM" is the name of a c64/pet/vic20 basic program.
Tells its starting/ending address and its length in bytes and blocks.
Then it lists the program.

EXTRA: if LG is specified FROM is an LASERGENIUS/MACHINELIGHTNING assembly
source code.

EXTRA: if TA is specified FROM is an TURBOASSEMBLER (c64) assembly source
code. (not yet working, sorry!)


System requirements:

  bList should run on any system setup running OS2.04 or higher, although it
has only been tested on an A3000/25 running OS3.1.  If you find bugs or have
suggestions about how to make the program better please send a bugreport or
a list of suggestions to the address at the end of this text.
