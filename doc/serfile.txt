serfile
-------
  serfile uses a PC as a harddisk for your C64/VIC20.  (run 'over5 server'
on the PC)

USAGE:
  Load and run.
Now it is installed ($f600-$ffff)

Commands:

  'LOAD "<FILENAME>",6'
  '#L"<FILENAME>"'
  '/ "<FILENAME>"' or '/<FILENAME>'
Loads the file from the server into memory.

  'SAVE "<FILENAME>",6'
  '#S"<FILENAME>"'
Saves file from memory to the server.

  '#C"<COMMAND>"'
  '."<COMMAND"' or '.<COMMAND>'
Sends command to the server. ('#$' can be used instead of '#C"$"')

  '#C"DIR"'
  '#C"$"'
  '#$'
  '$'
  '.$'
Displays the files in the current directory.

  '#C"CD"'
  '.CD'
Displays the name of the current directory.

  '#C"CD <dir>"'
  '.CD <dir>'
Set the current directory to <dir>.

Please refer to over5.txt for additional '#C' commands.

  '#K'
Uninstalls serfile.

The '#L', '/' and '#S' commands are slightly better than 'LOAD' / 'SAVE' because
they do not use BASIC variable storage to store the filename.  (i.e they do
not trash memory just below $a000)

SerFile looks dead during transfer. (screen blanked, no flashing)
This is normal!  I will make it flash a bit in late versions.


System requirements:

  serfile should run on any c64 or c128(in c64 mode), although it has only
been tested on an old c64 with, and without TFC III.  If you find bugs or
have suggestions about how to make any of the programs better please send
a bugreport and/or a list of suggestions to <over5@kahlin.net>.
