over5kernal
-----------
  over5kernal is a kernal extension for the C64 computer.  It replaces
tape and old RS-232 support in the original kernal with serfile, memslave,
and a number of useful other function.

USAGE
  Powering up the computer, or pressing an optional reset button, starts
your computer with over5 extensions installed.

Holding down the following keys during power up or reset:
- '<-' will immediately enter memslave server mode.
- <space> will skip normal autostart cartridge check and do reset.
- <ctrl> will flash the screen indefinately.

If RxD (PA0, bit 0 of $DD01) is held low during reset (signalling a break),
the kernal will wait 400ms for it to go high (signalling that the break
ended).  If it goes high, memslave server mode will be entered.  If it stays
low, it is assumed to be stuck for some reason, and a normal reset will
follow.
