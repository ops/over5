Short description of a level converter:

the userport of the c64 does not fully support RS232 voltages.

        "real RS232"     c64

mark     -12 volts     +5 volts
space    +12 volts      0 volts

The converter has to translate these voltages.  It also has to
have a c64 userport connector in one end and a standard RS232 connector
(DSUB-25) in the other.

It does NOT have to support handshaking-lines (CTS/RTS), only datain/out
(RxD, TxD).

These level converters were commercially availible from serveral companies.
Commodore has made one. (VIC-1011A RS232C)  In Sweden the 'Handic V24' was
popular.  There also exists several schematics on this type of interface.

All of them plugs into the userport, and are fairly simple. (consists of
only a few components.)


Happy computing...
