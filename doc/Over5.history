Over5 0.711 (960420) tlr - Fifth release version.
  - COPY code works ok.  Documented 'mach.c' so that porting by non Amiga
    people should be possible.

Over5 0.694 (960417) tlr - INTERNAL
  - finetuned COPY code... still some to be done though.

Over5 0.685 (960417) tlr - INTERNAL
  - COPY recoded.  Now supports real AmigaDos wildcard for both
    c64 and Amiga files.  Really neat!  
  - Made furter advances towards portable code.

Over5 0.660 (960416) tlr - INTERNAL
  - Now uses config file!  (PROGDIR:Over5.config)
    for you to be able to use other serial.devices.
  - Reworked the number input routine.
    now accepts binary (%11101) hex ($ef,0xff), octal (@777),
    and decimal(+22,#22).

Over5 0.624 (960405) tlr - INTERNAL
  - Did major work on the boot procedure.
    Should work with most cbm 8-bitters
  - nice progress indicators during boot.
  - Tested the above on: C64, VIC-20 16KB & VIC-20 3.5KB
    works very smoothly!

Over5 0.587 (960402) tlr - Fourth Release version.
  - bumped revision for release.
  - found nasty bug when closing the serial.device; a guru popped up now and
    then.

Over5 0.571 (960325) tlr - INTERNAL
  - moved back old boot, and move new boot to BOOT NEW.
  - WRITEZIP & READZIP now recognizes things like:
    'work:archives/1!kooldemo' or '/demos/thedemo'

Over5 0.561 (960322) tlr - INTERNAL
  - moved old boot to option BOOT OLD
  - created new and better boot procedure should work with VIC-20 aswell.

Over5 0.547 (960124) tlr - INTERNAL
  - added SAFEADDR option to BOOT
  - made WRITEZIP recognize "1!<basename>" instead of just "<basename>"

Over5 0.532 (960118) tlr - INTERNAL
  - recoded copytail.asm, it's now totally position independant and
    machine independant. (C64, VIC-20, PET, C128, etc...)
    This hopefully makes BOOT.ASC usable with most 6502 based commodore
    computers.

Over5 0.528 (960116) tlr - INTERNAL
  - Repaired the copy function! (nasty bug, always wrote 13 bytes)

Over5 0.477 (951110) tlr - INTERNAL

    reson.
