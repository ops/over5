Remember that this is a BETA version.  It contains bugs, some of which may
be major.  I am currently working on new versions of this program, but if
noone shows interest in this I might stop.  An email with some constructive
critisism will help me alot!

Possible bugs:

  - wildcards are case sensitive, even for cbm filenames and cbm
    filenames are always uppercase. (if no wildcards are used, lowercase
    is ok though)

  - the current directory ('.') must be specified as './', otherwise 
    copy will fail.

  - there may be a problem with using the fileturbo together with a 
    Commodore 1571 drive.  The last byte of some disk blocks may be
    incorrectly transferred. (If you have a 1541, Pitch's bug section
    below doesn't apply.)

  - Some diskturbos, like the one i AR IV leaves the serial pins in a mess
    after loading.  Mainly a problem with SERVER.  To solve this.  If
    serfile times out, just restart the server on the host.

  - Over5 SERVER may have to be started twice in a row to work properly.

  - The booter might freeze if a BASIC patch is installed, like AR IV.
    please turn OFF cartridges before booting.

  - fileturbo does not work with two or more units on the IEC bus.

  - SerFile looks dead during transfer. (screen blanked, no flashing)
    This is normal!

  - You MUST initialize the disk before doing WRITEDISK or READDISK

  - You may need to init drive after formatting and/or writing disk-
    ('over5 COMMAND i0')

  - trackturbo will make the 1541 driveled flash kind of funny. (historical 
    reasons :-)

  - COPY will not accept 'Over5 COPY 8:xx#? ram:t' where 'ram:t' is a
    directory.  Use 'Over5 COPY 8:xx#? ram:t/' instead.

  - COPY accepts 'Over5 COPY apa#? 8:rajraj/'.  You may see this as an odd
    feature.

  - WRITEDISK eats its arguments in the wrong order. The 'FROM' and 'DEVICE'
    arguments must switch places for it to work. This should only affect the
    w32/*nix ports.

Take care, out there!
